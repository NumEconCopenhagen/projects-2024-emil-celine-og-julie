# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Sectoral shifts in Denmark** and is an analysis of sectoral growth and shifts from 2010 to 2021 in Denmark.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. virksomheder.xlsx (*Statistics Denmark GF3*) 

The dataset GF3 from Statistics Denmark contains information about the number of firms in Denmark, categorized by different sectors within the non-financial business sector. It covers the years from 2010 to 2021 and shows the development in the number of firms within sectors such as industry, construction, trade and transport, information and communication, real estate, and business services.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

**Conclusion:** The analysis reveals that while the information and communication and business service sectors have shown significant growth in Denmark from 2010 to 2021, traditional sectors like industry have faced challenges, highlighting the need for innovation and adaptation to maintain a balanced and thriving economy.
