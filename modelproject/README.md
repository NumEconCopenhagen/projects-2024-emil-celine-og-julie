# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The OLG model with a PAYG system** and is about the dynamics of capital accumulation in an OLG model. We investigate how a pay-as-you-go tax and different population growth rates affect the capital accumulation in the model. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Conclusion:** In this project, we found that both higher population growth rates and the introduction of a PAYG system decrease the steady-state capital per worker, highlighting the trade-offs between demographic trends, intergenerational transfers, and economic growth.
