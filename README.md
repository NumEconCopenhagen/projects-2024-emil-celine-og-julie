This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Statistics Denmark** on **the number of firms in Denmark** categorized by different sectors within the non-financial business sector and show the shifts within the sectors over time. The information and communication and business service sectors grow while the industry sector have faced challenges.
3. Model project. We model the **OLG model with and without a pay-as-you-go system** in order to analyze how a PAYG tax affects the capital accumulation. Further we investigate how population growth also affects the capital accumulation. Both higher population growth rates and the introduction of a PAYG system decrease the steady-state capital per worker.
