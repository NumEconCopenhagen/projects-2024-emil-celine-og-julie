# Exam project

Our exam project is based on the content of the following problem areas: Problem 1) Production economy and CO2 taxation, problem 2) Career choice model and Problem 3) Barycentric interpolation.

The **results** of the exam project can be seen from running [exam.ipynb](exam.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
